# Generation of the domain (mesh)

Due to the simplicity of the geometry, the direct use of FEniCSx to create the domain was possible.

The following steps were to be followed:
1. Import the required libraries,
2. Define the geometrical quantities and create the mesh,
3. identify the boundaries and mark them.
